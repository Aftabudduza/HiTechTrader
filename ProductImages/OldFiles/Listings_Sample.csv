The preparation of job schedules, machine status, and location of the wafer can all be easily displayed on the CRT.    The electron optics system consists of a thermal field emission gun and electrostatic beam blanking and has been specifically designed for optimization at low KeV operation. Requires no water cooling and the final lense is finely pointed to permit tilting of 200mm wafers with no increase in the working distance. Beam blanked except when acquiring an image thereby reducing beam induced damage.    The scanning system operates at TV rates. The display of images is on a dedicated high resolution 14"" color monitor with image processing and storage included.

The material falls on to the hot smooth surface of the screw less cylindrical rotor. As the rotor turns, the material adheres to its surface and is subsequently forced against the inclined stationary surface of the scroll. As the rotor keeps turning the materials is conveyed towards the header containing the extruding orifice. While being conveyed, the material is collected in the radial gap and is pressured between the scroll surface and the header. The material is melted and enters the section between the end of the rotor and the inside surface of the header where it is rotationally sheared. This rotational shearing causes mixing and homogenization and the rotational shearing induces a centripetal pumping effect.

A Teflon septum cover allows reagent addition and sampling reaction content in each of the 24 reaction vessels.  Reactors sit inside a sealed chamber which is continuously swept with nitrogen or argon gas maintaining an inner atmosphere in each of the reactor vessels.  Mixing is achieved by either mounting the reactor on a bench top shaker (recommended) or using magnetic stirring. Heating is provided by a built-in heating element with regulation of +/- 0.1C using J-KEM's digital temperature controller. The KEM-Prep reactor also has an internally milled and sealed coolant flow path that surrounds all the reactors.

55004,002060531A,NULL,"Gelbo Flex Tester. For testing of laminated plastics. Failure is determined by measuring the pinholes formed in a barrier structure after being subjected to the Gelbo flex test. Gelbo tester consists essentially of a 90mm diameter stationary mandrel and a 90mm diameter moveable mandrel spaced at a distance of 180mm apart from face to face at the starting position (that is maximum distance) of the full stroke.    The mandrels contain vents to prevent pressurisation of the samples. The motion of the moveable mandrel is controlled by a grooved shaft, to which it is attached.    The groove is designed to give a twisting motion of 440 in the first 90mm of the stroke of the moveable mandrel, followed by a straight horizontal motion of 65mm, so that at the closed position the mandrels are 25mm apart.    The motion of the Gelbo flex tester is reciprocal with a full cycle consisting of the forward and return strokes.    For the partial flex test cycle, the moveable mandrel is set up to travel only 80mm of the 180mm spacing. Therefore, only 90 per cent of the twisting stroke is utilised giving a twisting motion of only 400, and none of the horizontal stroke is utilised.    A stainless steel template 200mm x 280mm is supplied for ease of preparing test sample size.    Flexible, double sided, pressure sensitive tape no more than 13mm wide, is used to hold the sample on to the mandrels, which will need to be supplied by the user along with a paint brush, absorbent tissue paper, white paper and coloured, water free, turpentine.
