The absence of a heating element eliminates an ignition source when working with atmospheres containing flammable vapors. A blower moves the air around the chamber to create turbulence and friction, which creates an even heat.    The temperature can be set using one of Blue M's standard control systems. A temperature-sensitive bellows regulates how much ambient air enters the blower. As the temperature rises to the setpoint, the bellows expand to open the control gate. Sharp temperature curve-off and temperature stabilization occurs as more air enters the system.    The by-pass damper can be set to a horizontal position restrict the air flow through the blower to minimize the amount of heat generated for control at lower temperatures. When the by-pass damper is set to a vertical position, the air circulates a maximum velocity for maximum heat.    While the system requires a large amount of air volume to generate heat, most of the air passes through a by-pass chamber that surrounds the work chamber. A small percentage of air passes through the inner chamber.",Blue M,HS-1004-1- 3,Good,Current,NULL,2758,83016.jpg,1,3000,0,0,1,0,0,0,Row 1 11-a,NULL,9435,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4/8/2011,6/24/2013,NULL,NULL,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ6aOld0xkg,0,83,98.110.127.30
