Then, under carefully controlled conditions, lithium atoms from the n-type diffused layer are made to migrate, or ""drift"", through the silicon disc, taking up positions within the material so as to compensate for the original p-type impurities.  If done properly, the result within the drifted region is a net dopant of intrinsic proportions.  Finally, the original p-type contact is replaced by a thin gold surface barrier contact which is transparent to soft X-rays.  Under conditions of reverse bias, a photon interacting within the intrinsic region frees electrons and holes (charge carriers) which are swept by the electric field to their respective collecting electrodes.

A lock-in (hold) capability causes each reading to remain displayed until the next density measurement is made.  The instrument can be used for absolute readings (i.e., conventional densitometer mode) or for density--difference readings (i.e., null-comparator mode).  In null-comparator mode, the density display of measured samples is in terms of plus (+) or minus (-) deviations from a known sample; operator computations are not necessary.  Additionally, instrument zeroing or nulling (in each filter position) is instantaneous and is accomplished without control adjustment.

Compared to pneumatic nebulization, detection of sample analytes is typically improved by an order of magnitude with the ultrasonic nebulizer.  The sensitivity increase is typically found when used with either an ICP-AES or ICP-MS instrument.  In operation, liquid sample is pumped onto the face of the piezoelectric transducer of the ultrasonic nebulizer where it is converted to a fine, dense aerosol.  The nebulizer gas flow transports the wet aerosol through the heated U-tube where the solvent is vaporized.

This band is rotated while the solvent is being distilled, and results in much higher separating efficiencies than would otherwise be possible.  The system is designed to efficiently purify contaminated solvents back to a grade suitable for reuse.  It is also used as an efficient distillation system in laboratory settings.  The Packed Column models use a packing material to create surface that increases separating efficiencies.  This system is also effective for solvent recycling and efficient laboratory distillations.

The recorder is designed as a compact device for mains voltages of 110 V and 220/240 V.  Two measuring units, ""1"" and ""5"", with calibrated measuring ranges graded in decades and steplessly adjustable intermediate ranges, enable the recording of values from 1 mV/cm to 10V/cm on measuring unit 1, and of 0.1 mV/cm to 50 V/cm on measuring unit 5.  Measuring unit 5 is also equipped with a calibrated zero suppression of 2 x 100 %, which means that even relatively small signals with a large base level can be enlarged up to three times and then represented.  The possibility of switching from XY to Yt operation, with external time unit control such as Start, Hold, Reset and Pen Down, opens up a further range of applications.

Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.  The Dial Viscometer rotates a sensing element in a fluid and measures the torque necessary to overcome the viscous resistance to the induced movement.  This is accomplished by driving the immersed element, which is called a spindle, through a beryllium copper spring.  The degree to which the spring is wound, indicated by the red pointer, is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid.  The Viscometer is able to measure over a number of ranges since, for a given spring deflection, the actual viscosity is proportional to the spindle speed and is related to the spindle's size and shape.  For a material of given viscosity, the resistance will be greater as the spindle size and/or rotational speed increase.  The minimum viscosity range is obtained by using the largest spindle at the highest speed; the maximum range by using the smallest spindle at the slowest speed.",2700,0,2011-03-18,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

When supplying an air source to this exhaust block aspirator, the velocity flow of the material is increased.  Varying the air pressure at this point will cause a higher degree of turbulence at the throttle plate in the sample cup, which will increase the separation force of the material as it flows through the closed dry sampler.

Using a latest-generation single-sided dual-electrode Inconel sensor coupled with a new fixed-frequency bridge signal conditioner, the 122A provides operation which is inherently temperature stable at zero pressure, capable of withstanding high overpressure conditions with minimal or no shifts in output over its range, and high resistance to corrosive environments.  The variable-capacitance sensor is the result of over 25 years of research, development and customer experience in total pressure measurement.  The design incorporates a tensioned metal diaphragm (Inconel), one side of which is exposed to the gas whose pressure is to be measured.  The other (reference) side of the diaphragm contains a dual-electrode assembly (previously found in premium transducers only) sealed in a high vacuum reference cavity which is maintained by a chemical getter system.  The signal conditioning electronics board contains a fixed-frequency oscillator, balance-sensing circuit, linearization circuitry and amplifiers which provide a 0-10 Volt DC full scale output.  The signal conditioner is inherently temperature stable at balance (pressure=0 Torr) and is self-compensating with temperature changes at other pressures.  A drawn aluminum can forms the protective cover for the transducer and a PC board mounted removable terminal block allows connections to be easily made for +/- 15 VDC power inputs and the 0-10 VDC pressure signal output.  In addition the aluminum cover works in conjunction with an inner PC shield board with RF bypass capacitors to virtually eliminate RFI and EMI.

The valve would normally be flange mounted to a Roots blower, diffusion, turbo, cryo, or other high vacuum pump (running at full speed).  The valve's butterfly is positioned to modulate the gas flow (pumping speed as seen by the chamber), thereby controlling pressure within the vacuum chamber.  A special feature of the valve is a nonlinear actuator placed between the butterfly shaft and the motor drive shaft whose function is to generate a linear valve transfer characteristic.  Practically speaking, the 252 Controller will need little, if any, gain and phase lead adjustment as it operates the valve from the full/closed to full/open position.

At the start of the test in this calorimeter the bomb is immersed in a glass Dewar while the combustion sample, either solid or liquid, is held within the bomb.  After the calorimeter has come to thermal equilibrium, the operator starts the reaction by electrically igniting a fuse which in turn kindles the sample.  The reaction then proceeds to completion and the heat produced by the combustion raises the temperature of the calorimeter.  Throughout the test, temperatures in the calorimeter are sensed by a thermistor and read from an electronic bridge which is built into the calorimeter case.  Deviations from the bridge reading are traced by a potentiometric strip chart recorder to produce a thermogram showing the temperature change produced by the reaction.

In practice it is found that for a homologous series of compounds a sigmoidal relationship exists between their various elution volume parameters and the logarithm of their molecular weights.  A calibration curve is prepared by measuring the elution volumes of several standard substances, calculating their corresponding Kav values (or similar parameter), and plotting their Kav values versus the logarithm of their molecular weight.  The molecular weight of an unknown substance can then be determined from the calibration curve once its Kav value is calculated from its measured elution volume.  For accurate determination of molecular weight, the calibration standards must have the same relationship between molecular weight and molecular size as the substance of interest.

This system is manufactured from a microprocessor controlled microwave oven and uses the relevant digital control functions incorporated in the microwave oven.  The PLASMA-PREEN system also has an additional analog power control feature added to provide a wider control range of plasma power.  This system operates by flowing a process gas (usually oxygen or argon) at reduced pressure (from 1 to 5 torr) through the process chamber and exciting the plasma discharge with the microwave energy from the microwave oven.  This process produces ionized gas species and free radicals within the gas.  These active species sputter and/or react with the work within the chamber.  Since this process occurs in the gas phase at reduced pressure, little material is consumed or discharged.

Rate of flow is varied by adjusting the metering valve.  The revolving wiper blades contact this liquid and spread it out in a thin film and also create a turbulence to expose more of the material to the vaporizing heat.  The slots in the blades force the liquid downward.  Varying the speed of the motor will result in a change of flow rate downward of the liquid, thus varying its residence time in the heating zone.  Residence time can be somewhat increased over gravity flow by reversing the motor.  Depending upon the temperature at the evaporating surface, the more volatile components of the liquid will be evaporated as the liquid flows down the wall through the heating zone.  The resultant vapor contacts the condenser or condensers, where it is condensed and flows downward into the distillate receiver flask.  Any liquid on the evaporating surface which is not evaporated continues to flow downward and into the residue receiving flask.

The complete YAG pumped dye laser is called Datachrom 5000.  Previous designs of Quantel dye lasers have used the grazing-incidence grating method for tuning.  The new Moya Dye Laser Cavity design improves the grazing-incidence method by using higher resolution gratings for better wavelength selectivity.  The key to the low level of fluorescence of the Moya oscillator lies in the pumping configuration and the way energy is coupled out of the cavity.  A portion of the intracavity beam undergoes total internal reflection off the dye cell window.  This configuration ensures that the main direction of emission of the fluorescence does not coincide with the direction of the beam.

Each direction finder utilizes two loops, permanently displaced at an angle of 90° with respect to each other, and mounted on a common vertical axis.  This pair of loops called the loop assembly, on which is also mounted the collapsible antenna, is rotatable about its common vertical axis.  The signal picked up by each loop and by the antenna is fed through a pair of shielded conductors to separate collector rings, which rotate with the loop assembly, and thence through stationary brushes into the receiver.  Each receiver is a specially designed twin channel superheterodyne for AM signals and operates from a dynamotor power supply.  Each channel amplifies the signal received by its respective loop, and the separate amplified outputs are connected to individual movements of the bearing meter, the pointers of which move and intersect over a common dial.",3278,0,2011-05-10,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The rotating head has ten stainless-steel rollers.  As the head rotates, five of the rollers press the tubing up against the compression arm, producing flow by peristaltic action.  Five rollers constantly in contact with the tubing ensures low pulsation, smooth flow, and high pressure.  The Model RP-1 pump is ideal for critical liquid chromatography, gradient generation, and flow analyzer applications.  The RP-1 incorporates a unique cam design: the adjustment screw does not press the compression arm directly.  Instead, turning the adjustment screw in the RP-1 moves a cam which applies gradual force to the compression arm.  This results in more precise flow control and reduced tubing wear.  The RP-1 is powered by a high torque stepper motor, controlled by a microprocessor with unique feedback circuitry for good speed stability, even at extremely low flow rates.  Speed stability is maintained between 0° - 40°C and against back-pressures of up to 5 bars.  Pump speed is shown in revolutions per minute and a liquid crystal display on the pump front panel.

4331,Temperature Controller,Eurotherm,2404,M-001111122,Efile,"Atmosphere Controllers provide accurate display and control of the carbon level in carburizing furnaces or ceramic glazing kilns. There are three different controllers that connect to a zirconia probe which measures the % oxygen in the furnace. The carbon level is calculated from the % oxygen and temperature measured by the probe. An optional third analog input can accept the output signal from a CO or H2 analyzer thus providing a more precise carbon or dewpoint measurement. The controllers are compatible with probes from the following manufacturers: • Drayton • Accucarb • AACC/MSI • SSI • Macdui/Barber-Colman • Bosch Lambda In addition to carbon level the controllers can be configured to measure and control either: • % oxygen or log oxygen • Dewpoint in °C or °F • Probe millivolts Advanced control algorithms ensure accurate, stable control. A range of plug-in modules are used to provide control, retransmission and alarm outputs. The control outputs can be mA or volts; time proportioning relay, logic or triac; or raise/lower outputs to a motorized valve and slide wire. A probe clean output is available to force compressed air through the probe at regular intervals to burn-off soot deposits. A sooting alarm will warn if carbon deposits build up to a level that can cause false readings. Probe health is monitored by measuring the time it takes the probe MV reading to recover from a self-clean operation.
