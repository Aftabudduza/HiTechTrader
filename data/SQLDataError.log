I would like to know if you can send me some additional pictures.  Some I would particularly like is the top of the glass reservior chamber, The same shot from the back of the unit and inside of the circuit boards (this can be accessed simply by turning the large screw at the top left side of the unit.      I do have a few questions:  1   Does the machine fire up?  2   What is the serial Number of the unit?  3   When powered up do the LED light illuminate?  Also if you push the button next to the LED does the light go on or off?    4   When you increase the speed on the recirculation indicator does the magnetic pump on the side of the unit (behind the tall glass reservior) spin and change speeds as you increase the rate?    5  At the top of the reservior there are 2 glass rods is there a device/cover (black) that goes over those two rods?   6.  Is there a pH probe in the reservior and/or is there a cable to attach it to the bulkhead?   7.  On the lower glass bottle is there an aluminum cover (it is not present in the picture)?  8.  If you plug in the white square (4 prong) connector from the tray into the bulkhead and have the Heater switch not disabled does the tray get warm?  9  In order to get the big pump on the front to turn you will have to have the black cover over the glass rods (see 5) and the drain LED will have to be off.      If you want to answer me by email that is fine.  If you want me to walk you through any of the questions feel free to call me at (608) 230-2199.    One final questions do you see many of these machines?  I may be interested in them even for some spare parts if they don'w work.    Thank you for you efforts in advance.

However these are much larger than we need and our space is limited (the room these are in was reduced 20% during the same construction project).  We are hoping to sell and replace these with smaller (4') hoods, which will give us enough space to 're-install' counters and cabinets (which we had to remove to fit these hoods in the room!).  We might be open to an exchange for a suitable smaller replacement if the difference covers shipping costs.<br/><br/>Items to Purchase:<br/> I saw your postings 001020202 (Nuaire NU704300) and 00100912 (Nuaire NU701300) - one of these might be suitable to replace our negative-pressure hood.  I was trying to find out whether they would be suitable for preparation of hazardous medications (chemotherapy or gene therapy - viruses).  What we need are one positive-pressure hood and one negative-pressure hood, both around 4' wide (total width preferably no more than 4.5 feet) and both with a front-loading antechamber.  For the positive-pressure hood we'd prefer round arm ports (to permit use of an 'iris' port instead of a sleeve).  First priority is sale of the existing hoods though, as that $ is needed for the replacements.<br/>We need these in the future.<br/><br/>Items For Sale:<br/>We have two 'almost new' Baker glovebox pharmacy isolators, Class III:  -  CHEMOSHIELD CS600, 6' negative-pressure, pharmacy glovebox isolator, Ser# 93617, MFG DATE 12/29/07.

I was wondering if you had any positions available part time.  I know that he can pretty much take apart, repair, and put back together almost anything electronic.  He also has his own soldering equipment.  I'm sure his electronics teacher would give him an excellent reference.    I know this is a long shot, especially being he isn't quite 17.  But I figured it would be worth a try.  He loves electronics of all kinds. I would much rather see him doing something that fits in with his college plans than working at a fast food place or in the mall.  Thank you.

I was wondering if you could check/see (a) whether the legs are removable and (b) if there's anything else underneath the unit that would keep us from lowering the unit to the ground.    We have some height restrictions here - very old building - 2 of our 3 paths into the building are under 80" and the 3rd path is barely at the 82" mark.    What we'd be looking at, is possibly taking the legs off and placing it onto a couple of short roller boards (1" wheels or casters).    If it looks like we could do that, then this might work.  We'd need to find out though before we order.    Thanks!  Ken','Inquiry','','','50089','0','0','7/12/2011');
